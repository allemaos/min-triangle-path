#####Assumptions - Notes

1. While reading about the [higher order functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function) 
note I dialectically supposed that I had to implement the solution of a binary tree and then extend it to higher space dimensions. 
When I read again about the higher order functions I left behind this extension. 

2. Another approach to implement the exercise is to use graph theory and the [dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra's_algorithm). 
The current minimum triangle path can be transformed to the shortest path between nodes I and II in a graph, where each edge (or neighbor's distance) 
is the inversed and normalized input values. 

3. The implemented approach is based on the BFS search of a binary tree using higher order functions of java8.
